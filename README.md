# ruby_recursion

The Odin project assignments

Assignment #1: 

Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

Then write a method using recursion

Assignment #2

Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
